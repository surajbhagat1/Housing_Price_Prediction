# House Price Prediction Model
This repository features a basic house price prediction model created with Python. The project adheres to a systematic approach, encompassing data cleaning and model development using Ridge regression.


# Key Components
## The model uses a dataset from Kaggle titled "HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION - SEATTLE: Real house price data from Seattle, Washington." The dataset is cleaned to address missing values, process categorical data, and perform other preprocessing tasks.

## Model Development: The machine learning model is built using Ridge regression with the scikit-learn library. The trained model is saved for future use.
